ConstantTableSaver
==================

Loads all records from the table on first use, and thereafter returns the
cached (and frozen) records for all find calls.

Optionally, creates class-level methods you can use to grab the records,
named after the name field you specify.


Compatibility
=============

Currently tested against Rails 2.3.14, 3.0.17, 3.1.8, and 3.2.8.


Example
=======

Txn.all.each {|txn| .. do something with txn.txn_type ..}
 - would load each txn_type individually

Txn.all(:include => :txn_type).each {|txn| .. do something with txn.txn_type ..}
 - would load the txn_types in one go after the txns query, but would still need
   a query every time you load txns


But if you use:

  class TxnType
    constant_table
  end

Txn.all.each {|txn| .. do something with txn.txn_type ..}
  - no longer requires individual txn_type loads, just every time you start the
    server (or every request, in development mode)

TxnType.all
  - also cached, but:

TxnType.all(:conditions => "name LIKE '%foo%'")
TxnType.find(2, :lock => true)
  - all still result in traditional finds, since you gave options


You can also use:

  class TxnType
    constant_table :name => :label
  end

Which if you have:

  TxnType.create!(:label => "Customer Purchase")
  TxnType.create!(:label => "Refund")

Means you will also have methods returning those records:

  TxnType.customer_purchase
  TxnType.refund

Optionally, you can specify a :name_prefix and/or :name_suffix.
