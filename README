ConstantTableSaver
==================

Loads all records from the table on first use, and thereafter returns the
cached (and frozen) records for all find calls.


Example
=======

Txn.find(:all).each {|txn| .. do something with txn.txn_type ..}
 - would load each txn_type individually

Txn.find(:all, :include => :txn_type).each {|txn| .. do something with txn.txn_type ..}
 - would load the txn_types in one go after the txns query, but would still need
   a query every time you load txns


But if you use:

class TxnType
  constant_table
end

Txn.find(:all).each {|txn| .. do something with txn.txn_type ..}
  - no longer requires individual txn_type loads, just every time you start the
    server (or every request, in development mode)

TxnType.find(:all)
  - also cached, but:

TxnType.find(:all, :conditions => "name LIKE '%foo%'")
TxnType.find(2, :lock => true)
  - all still result in traditional finds, since you gave options
